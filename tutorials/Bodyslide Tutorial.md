# Using Bodyslide

This guide will provide a quick run down of how to use Bodyslide to build armors for compatibility with [OBody](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77016?) or [AutoBody](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61321). For this guide we will be using the [Kvetchi Mercenary Set](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79226), as well as the [3BA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83171) and [HIMBO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86564) conversions for it. 

This guide will not be covering how to install or set up the mods themselves, as that should be knowledge you have by this point.

## Setting up Bodyslide

The first thing to do is to make sure your Bodyslide is properly configured.

**Step 1**: Find and launch the `BodySlide` executable in MO2.

**Step 2**: Navigate to the `Settings` button at the bottom right of the BodySlide window.

**Step 3**: Make sure that the `Target Game` is set correct and that the `Game Data Path` is pointing to the relevant data folder for your list.

## Building for 3BA

**Step 1**: In the `Outfit/Body` dropdown, find and select `CBBE 3BBB Body Amazing`. In the `Preset` dropdown, find and select `- Zeroed Sliders -`.

**Step 2**: Click on the `Group Filter` and select `Choose groups...`.

**Step 3**: In the popup box, look for the armor you want to build, in our case there is no group for our armor, so we will tick the box next to `Unassigned` at the bottom.

**Step 4**: Hit `OK` to close the box.

**Step 5**: At the bottom left, find `Batch Build...`, and while holding `L ctrl` click on it.

**Step 6**: In the new popup box navigate to find the BodySlide files for the armor you want to build. You can right click in the window and hit `Select None` to deselect everything. Once you have selected the relevant BodySlide files, click `Build`.

**Step 7**: BodySlide will now give you the option to select which folder you want to build your new bodyslide files to. Select whatever folder works for you. It is **not** recommended to build your new BodySlide files in the base mod.

**Step 8**: That's it, there are some potentially more complexities for some armors, but that is all that will be covered in this guide.

## Changes for HIMBO

While building for HIMBO, 3BA, BHUNP, SAM, etc are all fundamentally the same, there are some slight differences.

**Step 1**: In the `Outfit/Body` dropdown, find and select `HIMBO Body - SOS` OR `HIMBO Body - Vanilla (Nevernude)`. In the `Preset` dropdown, find and select `HIMBO Zero for OBody`.

**Step 2-8**: Proceed with the same steps as the 3BA guide above.
