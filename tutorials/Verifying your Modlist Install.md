# Verifying your Modlist Installation with Wabbajack - by iAmMe

## Introduction

Sometimes modlists aren't perfectly installed - computers are fallible and there are many reasons as to why a modlist doesn't install 100% correctly *but* Wabbajack has a function built in to verify a modlist install. If you suspect that something isn't right with your install for whatever reason, you can run this to get Wabbajack to check.

## Opening the Wabbajack modlist installation

So, how do we do this? First, start by opening Wabbajack and then head to the screen where you start the installation of a modlist, whether via the gallery or by clicking the "Install from Disk" option:

## Verifying the Modlist

In the bottom right of the window, click the "Verify Installation" button and let Wabbajack complete.

Once it is finished, it will open the report in your web browser which details the results of the verification.
